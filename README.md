## Welcome
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for Taylor's University. We're so exciting to have you all here. This event is being hosted by the [Agent of tech](https://university.taylors.edu.my/en/campus-life/activities-and-clubs/clubs-and-societies/agents-of-tech.html), please consider joining our club.

The [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-fall-fest-feb8456b557) is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from IBM Quantum. Student leaders work alongside IBM to design and plan their event, which are then run in the Fall on their local campus. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill set.
